          <div id="population_choropleth" class="vis-container-map"></div>
          <p>As the years go by, Malaysia and the world has shown a gradual increase in overall population. This visualization aims to give you information on how Malaysia's population has changed over the years, as well as how Malaysia's age group distribution is like. So without further adue, let us begin. The map above helps to show us the total population of each state in Malaysia (in the year 2020). States that are shaded with a darker shade of orange indicate a higher population and vice versa. A good example of this would be the state of <b>Selangor</b>. Shaded with the darkest shade of orange, it is currently <b>the most populated state in Malaysia</b>. For more information on each state, feel free to hover over the states on the map with your cursor.</p>

             <p>Now that we know how Malaysia's population is like in the year 2020, let us travel 10 years back in time, and observe how Malaysia's population has changed over 10 years. With the line chart on the left, we are able to observe Malaysia's population during <b>2010</b> was around <b>28208035</b> people. As the years went by, the total population rose to <b>32365999</b> in the year <b>2020</b>. This shows an addition of <b>4157964</b> in the country, which can also be said to be a <b>14.74% increase in population over 10 years</b>! If we continue to observe the line chart, we can also conclude that Malaysia's population has a gradual increase every year, which further reinforces the fact that Malaysia's population is ever-growing, and will continue to increase over the years to come.</p>

             <p>We know that Malaysia's population is gradually increasing, but do we know how it's age group distribution is like? The pie chart on the left shows us the <b>population of each age group</b> in Malaysia. If we observe this pie chart, we can see that most Malaysians are around the age group of 18 years and above, with this age group covering <b>71.68% of the total country's population</b>. It is also larger than the total population of the two other age groups combined! Coming in second is the age group of youngsters (aged below 18 years), the population of this age group covers <b>17.59% of the country's population</b>. Finally, the age group with the least individuals are the age group of 60 years and above, with a total of <b>3502000</b> individuals, covering <b>10.72% of the country's population</b>.</p>

             <p>Some states in Malaysia are known to have more individuals in a certain age group. To help visualise this, we can use the interactive bar chart on the left!
